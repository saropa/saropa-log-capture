# Automatic Capture

Saropa Log Capture works with **any debug adapter** - Dart, Node.js, Python, Go, C++, Java, and more.

## How it works

1. Start any debug session (F5)
2. Output is automatically captured to `reports/` folder
3. ANSI colors and stack traces are preserved

## What gets captured

- Console output (print, console.log, etc.)
- Standard output (stdout)
- Standard error (stderr)
- Debug messages from the adapter

No configuration needed - it just works!
